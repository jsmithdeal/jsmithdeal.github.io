        <h1>Notable Projects</h1>
        <p class="mt-3 mt-lg-0 p-5 p-lg-3 opening-blurb">
            Here are a few notable projects I've worked on. This isn't a complete list, but it should give you a sense of the type of work I do: from full-stack app development and API integrations to UI design and high-impact enterprise solutions.

    <div class="row ps-lg-5 mobile-padding">
        <span class="project">DocuSign eSignature Integration</span>
        <p class="pt-3 pt-lg-3 pb-lg-5">
            I designed and developed DCCU's DocuSign-integrated eSignature solution: an internal single-page application that has been in continuous use since 2019. It 
            streamlines the way staff prepare and sign legal documents by auto-filling member information and generating documents for signing, enabling hundreds of agreements to be processed every day.<br/><br/>
            The solution utilizes a C# Web Forms application (HTML, Javascript and CSS) for the front end, C# for backend controllers and models,
            and an MSSQL database. It's integrated with Jack Henry APIs for sourcing member information and DocuSign APIs for document generation and sending.

    <div class="row ps-lg-5 mobile-padding">
        <span class="project">ACH Stops Application</span>
        <p class="pt-3 pt-lg-3 pb-lg-5">
            I designed and developed an internal site for managing ACH stop payment orders on DCCU member accounts. It allows member representatives to efficiently and proactively review member accounts and clear
            or place orders according to their needs.<br/><br/>
            This application was built on the Angular framework, and therefore, primarily utilizes Typescript, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It uses Jack Henry APIs to source member account information and manipulate stop payment orders.

    <div class="row ps-lg-5 mobile-padding">
        <span class="project">DCCU Online and Mobile Banking UIs</span>
        <p class="pt-3 pt-lg-3 pb-lg-5">
            I designed and developed the color schemes, background imagery, and general look and feel to refresh DCCU's online/mobile banking site UIs. This project provided a more sleek, modern design to a platform that was beginning to look outdated.<br/><br/>
            This was done within Fiserv's Architect platform, and utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

    <div class="row ps-lg-5 mobile-padding">
        <span class="project">Lender Price Integration for Empower</span>
        <p class="pt-3 pt-lg-3 pb-lg-5">
            I worked on a small team to integrate Lender Price into NFCU's custom, in-house instance of Empower. Lender Price is a vendor providing mortgage rates via API, and Empower is a mortgage loan origination system (MLOS) from 
            third-party Dark Matter Technologies. This integration was built to replace Empower's native rate-pricing engine, and allows users to more efficiently and accurately price mortgages for members. This was a very high-impact project, and our solution processes
            rates for every mortgage that goes through NFCU.<br/><br/>
            The project utilizes technologies native to Empower, including C#, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and MSSQL.
        </p>

    <div class="row ps-lg-5 mobile-padding">
        <span class="project">API Additions and Modifications</span>
        <p class="pt-3 pt-lg-3 pb-lg-5">
            As mentioned under "Lender Price Integration for Empower," NFCU's MLOS is a customized version of Empower from Dark Matter Technologies. Empower comes out of the box with RESTful APIs to provide mortgage information to integrated systems,
            and being that NFCU's Empower solution is highly customized, the information it sources must be as well. As such, I've been involved in numerous projects related to API work, and have led the design and development of many endpoints for getting, posting,
            and patching various data points.<br/><br/>
            All the API endpoints and controllers I've developed have been done in C#, with some utilizing SQL and parameterized queries for data retrieval and updates.
