            <span class="hello">Hello and welcome!</span><br/><br/>
            I'm John Paul, a lifelong resident of a small town in the Shenandoah Valley, VA. I've always enjoyed problem solving, puzzles, and critical thinking
            which led me to pursue and complete a degree in computer science.<br/><br/>
            Since graduating in 2017, I've covered a lot of ground in terms of job knowledge and technical ability; I consider learning to
            be my strong suit and do my best to keep up with the times. While those traits are important aspects of my career that I maintain, 
            I've found through experience that raw skills are neither rare nor the driving factor behind a top-notch team member. In a job market where many people
            show up just for a paycheck, the two things I strive for are <span class="emphasis">reliability</span> and <span class="emphasis">quality</span>. When I say that I'll get something done,
            my team knows that it'll be done on time and with proactive communication. Not only will it be done, but it'll be done well: the end-user
            experience is always top of mind and any question marks erased through collaboration and research. These are the things that I believe are hard to find today, and
            they're a driving force behind both my career and everyday life.<br/><br/>
            Outside of my work and career aspirations, I have a few hobbies and try to stay active. I like to spend time after work and on the weekends with my wife and son (Lauren and Jack),
            play pickleball, practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and work on personal projects (like this website :D).<br/><br/>
            Thanks for stopping by - I look forward to connecting!
